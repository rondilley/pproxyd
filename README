== What is Passive Proxy Daemon (pproxyd)?

This tool reads pcap format files or reads packets directly from the network,
assembles web based traffic and generates squid proxy style logs.  Logs are
sent to standard out while in interactive mode and via syslog when running
as a daemon.  The log format is similar to native squid v1.1/2.x format.

time elapsed remotehost code/status bytes method URL rfc931 peerstatus/peerhost type

Time         Time in seconds followed by time in milliseconds
Elapsed      The elapsed time is in milliseconds.
Remotehost   The client connecting to the server and the source port
Code         TCP_MISS on success or TCP_FAIL if there was problen with the session
Status       HTTP response code.  000 on TCP_FAIL or no return
Bytes        Bytes send from server to client including headers
Method       HTPP command (GET, HEAD, POST, etc)
URL          URL follwing Method
Peerstatus   Always DIRECT
peerhost     Server recieving connection and the destination port
type         Content type

User agent string is contained within '[' ']'.

The log output has been adapted slightly to make the collected date more useful
to security practitioners including source and destination poirts following the
remotehost and peerhost fields and an additional field following type that
includes the user agent string provided in the client HTTP header.

== Why use it?

I use pproxyd to give quick and simple visibility into the web requests
that are passing through a given choke point without having to impliment
a proxy or make any changes to client configurations.  This is handy during
incident response as well as troubleshooting web applications.  Recently,
while troubleshooting issues with a load balancer, I used pproxyd to quickly
monitor both sides of the network device and the web server at the same time.
This configuration allowed easy determination of were the problem was
without having to poor through raw packets.

== Implementation

To get a list of all the options, you can execute the
command with the -h or --help switch.

----
pproxyd v0.2 [Feb  4 2012 - 07:52:05]

syntax: pproxyd [options] -r {fname}|-i {iface}
 -c|--chroot {dir}     chroot to {dir}
 -D|--daemon           run as a daemon, output goes to syslog
 -d|--debug (0-9)      enable debugging info
 -g|--group {group}    run as a different group
 -h|--help             this info
 -i|--int {iface}      specify interface to read from
 -P|--pid {fname}      specify pid file (default: /var/run/pproxyd.pid)
 -p|--ports {ports}    comma separated list of ports to monitor (default: 80,81,8080)
 -r|--read {fname}     read packets from pcap file
 -u|--user {name}      run as a different user
 -v|--version          display version information

The debug option is most useful when the tool is compiled
with the --ENABLE-DEBUG switch.
----

pproxyd runs in the forground and displays squid logs to standard out
unless the -D option is used.

You use the -r option to read a pcap format file,

To monitoring live network interfaces, you will need to start pproxyd
with sufficient priviledges to put the interface into promiscious
mode.  You can use the -u and -g options to drop priviledges and -c
to chroot pproxyd.

The -p option allows you to specify which ports to monitor for
web traffic.  The default is to listen to traffic on tcp port
80, 81 and 8080.

== Security Implications

Assume that there are errors in the this source that
would allow a specially crafted packets to allow an attacker
to exploit the tool to gain access to the computer that it is
running on!!!  Don't trust this software and install and use
it at your own risk.

== Bugs

I am not a programmer by any stretch of the imagination.  I
have attempted to remove the obvious bugs and other
programmer related errors but please keep in mind the first
sentence.  If you find an issue with code, please send me
an e-mail with details and I will be happy to look into
it.
